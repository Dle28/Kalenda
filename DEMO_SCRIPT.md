## 🎤 30-Second Elevator Pitch:

**Version 1 (Technical):**
"Kalenda is a Web3 creator economy platform on Solana. Unlike time.fun which only does bookings, we've added instant tipping with zero fees. Creators receive 100% of tips directly to their wallet in under 1 second. We use leaderboards for gamification and everything is transparent on-chain. We're planning NFT badges and subscriptions next."

**Version 2 (Business):**
"Imagine Patreon but creators keep 100% and get paid instantly. That's Kalenda. We built tipping on Solana - zero fees, instant transfers, full transparency. Today we shipped the MVP. Next: NFT rewards and recurring payments. We're rebuilding the creator economy on Web3."
