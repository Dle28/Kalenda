**Duration: 30 seconds**

│         💸 THE BOOKING PROBLEM          │
│                                         │
│   ❌ High Platform Fees (15-30%)       │
│   ❌ Slow Settlements (7-30 days)      │
│   ❌ No Pricing Flexibility            │
│   ❌ Zero Transparency                 │
│                                         │
│   Traditional platforms take too much   │
│   and give too little control          │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Speaker Notes:
> "Content creators and professionals lose 15-30% of their earnings to booking platform fees. Payments take weeks to settle, and there's no transparent pricing mechanism for high-demand time slots. The current system is broken."

### Speaker Notes:
> "Kalenda is live, working, and ready to disrupt the 104 billion dollar creator economy. We're seeking hackathon recognition and future partnerships to bring zero-fee, blockchain-verified booking to creators worldwide. Time is money - let's make it count on Solana. Thank you!"

---

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

> "Kalenda is a decentralized booking platform built on Solana blockchain. We eliminate platform fees entirely while enabling creators to monetize their time through both fixed pricing and competitive auctions. Every transaction is instant, transparent, and verifiable on-chain. Think Calendly meets Web3 - where creators keep 100% of their earnings, and bookers get blockchain-level trust. We've built a working MVP with Phantom wallet integration, supporting both SOL payments and auction bidding. Time is money - let's make it count on the blockchain."

---

## 📋 Q&A PREPARATION

### Q: How do you make money?
**A:** "Currently zero platform fees to bootstrap network effects. Future monetization through optional premium features like advanced analytics, calendar integrations, and enterprise white-label licensing. We may also implement a small optional creator tip mechanism where users can voluntarily tip the platform."

### Q: Why Solana vs Ethereum?
**A:** "Three reasons: Speed - 400ms vs 15 seconds. Cost - $0.0001 vs $5+ gas fees. User Experience - better for frequent transactions. Solana is also the home of the NFT and creator community, which is our core market."

### Q: What about smart contract security?
**A:** "Our MVP uses Solana's battle-tested SystemProgram for direct transfers. Before mainnet launch, we'll undergo a full security audit by a reputable firm. Our code is open source, and we'll implement multi-sig for any platform-controlled funds."

### Q: How do you handle disputes?
**A:** "V1 uses traditional customer support as a fallback. V2 will implement escrow with time-lock releases. V3 will have DAO-governed dispute resolution. But the key point is: every transaction is recorded on-chain as immutable proof of payment."

### Q: What's your go-to-market strategy?
**A:** "We're starting with micro-influencers and consultants who already understand Web3. We'll offer early creator incentives, build integrations with popular creator tools, and leverage the Solana community for initial traction. Content creators are already familiar with crypto - we just make it useful for their business."
