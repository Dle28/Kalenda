# CHECK YOUR SETUP

## Your current Treasury Address:
2eaTg4UY8nRmj16DWnASQwM88hAB1f4YXHUvMM5pTHWT

## To fix:
1. Open new Phantom wallet OR
2. Get a different wallet address
3. Replace TREASURY_ADDRESS in:
   apps/web/components/FakeReserveButton.tsx (line 7)

## To verify it works:
1. Book a slot
2. Check Solscan: FROM and TO should be DIFFERENT addresses
3. Your balance should DECREASE by slot price + fee

## Current behavior:
- FROM: Your wallet
- TO: Your wallet (SAME!)
- Result: Balance unchanged (only fee deducted)
